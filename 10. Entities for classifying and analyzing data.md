## How entities work in Sentinel
* Let's consider an example to illustrate how entities work in Azure Sentinel:

  * Suppose you have an organization's security logs from various sources such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and web servers being ingested into Azure Sentinel.
  * Within these logs, Azure Sentinel automatically extracts entities such as IP addresses, URLs, and usernames.

  * Here's how entities would be used in the context of a security incident:

1. **Detection**:
   - Azure Sentinel's analytics detects a series of failed login attempts from multiple IP addresses targeting a specific web server.
   - Entities extracted from these logs include IP addresses (source IP), usernames, and timestamps.

2. **Normalization**:
   - The extracted IP addresses are normalized to a standard format (e.g., IPv4) for consistent analysis.
   - Usernames are standardized to ensure consistency across different logs.

3. **Enrichment**:
   - Azure Sentinel enriches the extracted IP addresses with threat intelligence data, revealing that some of them are associated with known malicious activities or blacklisted IP ranges.
   - Usernames are enriched with additional context such as user roles or privileges.

4. **Correlation**:
   - Azure Sentinel correlates the failed login attempts with other related events, such as suspicious outbound traffic from the web server to external IP addresses.
   - Entities like IP addresses and URLs are correlated to identify patterns of behavior indicative of a potential breach attempt.

5. **Alerting**:
   - Azure Sentinel generates a security alert based on the correlation of events and the presence of entities associated with known threats or suspicious activities.
   - The alert includes details about the involved entities (e.g., IP addresses, usernames), timestamps, and the nature of the detected activity.

6. **Investigation**:
   - Security analysts investigate the alert by pivoting on the entities involved.
   - They search for additional logs related to the IP addresses and usernames identified in the alert, examining web server access logs, firewall logs, and authentication logs.
   - By analyzing the behavior of these entities over time, analysts determine the extent of the security incident and take appropriate response actions.

In this example, entities extracted from security logs play a central role in detecting, analyzing, and responding to a potential security incident. By leveraging entities, Azure Sentinel enables organizations to identify and mitigate threats more effectively, ultimately enhancing their overall security posture.

* Up to 500 entities collectively can be identified in a single alert, divided equally across all entity mappings defined in the rule.

    * For example, if two entity mappings are defined in the rule, each mapping can identify up to 250 entities; if five mappings are defined, each one can identify up to 100 entities, and so on.
    * Multiple mappings of a single entity type (say, source IP and destination IP) each count separately.
    * If an alert contains items in excess of this limit, those excess items will not be recognized and extracted as entities.
    * The size limit for the entire entities area of an alert (the Entities field) is 64 KB.

* Entities fields that grow larger than 64 KB will be truncated.
    * As entities are identified, they are added to the alert one by one until the field size reaches 64 KB, and any entities yet unidentified are dropped from the alert.

* Sentinel --> "Analytics" --> Pick a rule --> "Edit" from the ellipse sign
* "Set rule logic" --> "Add new entity" --> NExt... --> "Save"

## How to analyze the information collected
* Sentinel --> "Hunting" --> "New hunt" at the top --> "Create"
* Click on this new hunt created --> "Query actions" at the top --> "New query"
* We will need a query to create this new query which has to come from the rule that we want to  implement through this query:
    * Sentinel --> "Analytics" --> Ellipses sign of the selected rule  --> "Edit" --> "Set rule logic" --> Copy the rule query.
 
* Add entities under "Entity mapping":
  * "Host, HostName, timsetamp"
  * "Account, ObjectGuid,timestamp"
  * "IP, Address, IPCustomEntity"
 
* Under Tactics and techniques --> "Credential Access"
* "Create"
