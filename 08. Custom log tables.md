## What are Custome log tables used for?
* For store the data from a custom data source. Eg: A web service that is not connected to a SIEM tool traditionally.
* Inside Log Anaytics Workspace, "Tables" --> "Create" --> "New custome log (DCR-based)"


## Data collection endpoint
* These acts as a URL for the REST API representational state transfer to link between the service that we are trying to fetch the data from.

## How to create the Data collection endpoint
* Left menu --> "Monitor" --> Scroll down on the left menu --> "Data Collection endpoints" --> Create

* Go back to Log Anaytics Workspace --> "Tables" --> Create a custom log
* We will need sample data that can be found at: https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Sample%20Data/README.md
* Save that file as "Sample.json" --> and then browse and upload that file.
* If this file throws an error about TimeGenerated field is not found:
    * Replace the field "ts" with a field "TimeGenerated":
 
* Now create the custom table.
