# What is a Playbook
* It is a collection of remediation actions that we run form Sentinel as a routine to help automate our threat response.
* Sentinel provides many pre-built playbooks + Github repository (Azure-Sentinel/Playbooks)

## Scenario: We will try to give privileges to Sentinel Contributor and Logic App Contributor apps
* Go to the resource group linked with Sentinel --> "Acces Control"
* "Add" --> "Add role Assignment" --> Search "logic"
* Click "View" for "Logic app Contributor" --> "Assignments" --> "Add assignment"
* Then "Next" --> "Select members"

* Sentinel --> "Automation" --> "Playbook templates"
* Select the playbook template--> "Create playbook"
